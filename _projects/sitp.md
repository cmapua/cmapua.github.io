# Stuck in the Present

_Stuck in the Present_ is a 3D side-scrolling psychological horror title where two friends relive painful memories within the uncanny depths of twisting subway stations in a large, unfamiliar city.

Just as Faye and Rich’s painful memories resurface, the two friends are ensnared in the distorted corridors of a decrepit subway station beneath a city still foreign to Faye. To find any path through, they need to decipher all that they have so desperately tried to forget.

Face the past—it’s the only way forward.

# Contributions
Development for _Stuck in the Present_ underwent two major iterations, and my role and contributions have changed drastically between them.

In a previous, unreleased iteration, I was a member of the core engineering team with the following responsibilities:
- Wrote core architecture, several major gameplay features and systems, editor tools, and UI.
- Developed, maintained, and contributed to several internal Unity packages for use in this and other in-house projects. Some of those packages include [Input Manager](https://github.com/duskwavearts-engineering/input-manager) and [Game Flags](https://github.com/duskwavearts-engineering/game-flags).

In its current iteration, I took on a more consultational and supportive role:
- Consulted on narrative elements, such as Philippine cultural themes and experiences that were depicted in the game. 
- Offered solutions for rendering issues encountered during development, saving precious debugging time.
- Assisted in playtesting and bug reporting leading up to release.
